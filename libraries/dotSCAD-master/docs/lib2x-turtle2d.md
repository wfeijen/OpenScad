# turtle2d

The dir changed since 2.0. 

An OpenSCAD implementation of Turtle Graphics. It moves on the xy plane. You can get the cooridinate `[x, y]` or `angle` of its current position.

## Parameters

- `cmd` : A string command. Different commands use different numbers of arguments. 
    - `"create"` : Creates a turtle data. The command needs three arguments `x`, `y` and `angle`. For example, use `turtle2d("create", 5, 10, 30)` to create a turtle located at `[5, 10]` with an angle `30` degrees.
    - `"x"` : Sets or gets the `x` coordinate of a turtle. If you provide a turtle data and the `x` coordinate, such as `turtle2d("x", turtle, 20)`, it will sets the `x` coordinate. Giving a turtle data only will return the `x` coordinate.
    - `"y"` : Sets or gets the `y` coordinate of a turtle. If you provide a turtle data and   the `y` coordinate, such as `turtle2d("y", turtle, 20)`, it will sets the `y` coordinate. Giving a turtle data only will return the `y` coordinate.
    - `"angle"` : Sets or gets the angle of a turtle. If you provide a turtle data and the angle, such as `turtle2d("angle", turtle, 45)`, it will sets the angle. Giving a turtle data only will return the angle.
    - `"pt"` : Sets or Gets `[x, y]` of a turtle. If you provide a turtle data and the coordinates, such as `turtle2d("pt", turtle, [10, 20])`, it will sets the coordinates. Giving a turtle data only will return the coordinates.
    - `"forward"` : Forwards a turtle. The command needs two arguments. The first one is a turtle data, and the second one is the length. For example, `turtle2d("forward", turtle, 100)`.
    - `"turn"` : Turns a turtle. The command needs two arguments. The first one is a turtle data, and the second one is the angle. For example, `turtle2d("turn", turtle, 180)`.
